# Analysis-of-influencing-factors-of-housing-price-and-housing-price-forecast

analysis  of  influencing  factors  of  housing  price  is  an  important  method  to understand  the  logic  of  real  estate  pricing,  and  also  an important  judgment  to  predict the  trend  of  future  housing  price  changes.  However,  in  the  actual  analysis,  because researchers  do  not  have  a  deep  understanding  of  data  mining  technology,  they  are  not rigorous  in  the  selection  of  models.  On  the  basis  of  data  preprocessing  and  feature engineering,  this  paper  will  analyze  the  importance  of  features,  show  the  influence degree  of  each  feature  and  the  interaction  between  features  through  matplotlib,  and  then use  K-fold  cross-validation  and  random  grid  search  for  algorithm  comparison  and model  selection,  so  as  to  achieve  accurate  analysis  and  prediction  of  housing  price influencing  factors.
